This script is designed to analyze and process a dataset containing details about various anime series. The primary actions include:

Sorting the dataset based on the 'anime_id'.

Grouping and categorizing the anime series based on their 'status' and 'type' (e.g., TV, OVA).

Filtering to focus on anime with a specific status.

Dropping unnecessary columns for a cleaner dataset.

Searching for specific anime titles within the dataset.

Sorting the anime based on various metrics like 'score', 'rank', 'popularity', and 'premiered year'.

Renaming and replacing values in certain columns for clarity.

Extracting the year from the 'premiered' column and creating a new 'premiered year' column.

Saving the processed data to a new CSV file.
